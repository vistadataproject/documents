# VISTA Data Project

__*The VISTA Data Project is a new model-driven approach to access, interfacing, security, and master data management for all Veteran  health information across all VA VistA systems*__

The VA's Veteran Integrated Systems Technology and Architecture ([VISTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VistA)) is the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs integrated longitudinal  clinical, business, and administrative information system which supports the operations of over 1200 VA hospitals and clinics nationwide.  

VISTA's data model - the roadmap to all of VA's institutional, business, and clinical processes and data - has evolved organically over the past thirty-five years across all VistA systems in an opaque proprietary form, and has never been leveraged, exposed, or managed in a modern computable form.

In the VistA Data Project, VistA's internal operational clinical and business data model - the __*VistA Data Model*__ - is comprehensively exposed, enriched, and operationalized in a modern, secure, industry-standard computable form for all clinical operational VistA data.  

The VistA Data Model is in turn normalized across all of the distinct 130 VistA data models to create a single national, normalized __*Master Veteran Data Model*__ (MVDM), allowing read-write transactions across all VistA systems using a single, secure, veteran-centric, model-driven mechanism, MVDM Services:

*The figure above summarizes the evolution from __thousands of unique, inconsistent, insecure, unidirectional code-based interfaces__ to that of a __single, secure, standard, server-side, symmetric (bidirectional), service-based master data model-driven interface__.*
