# VISTA Data Project

__*The VISTA Data Project is a modern model-driven approach to master data management, interfacing, and security for all Veteran health information systems*__

The VA's Veteran Integrated Systems Technology and Architecture ([VISTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VistA)) is the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs integrated longitudinal  clinical, business, and administrative information system which supports the operations of over 1200 VA hospitals and clinics nationwide.  

VISTA's internal operational data model - the roadmap to all of VA's institutional, business, and clinical processes and data - has evolved organically over the past thirty-five years, but has never been leveraged, exposed, or managed in a modern computable form.

In the VistA Data Project,  VA's native operational clinical and business data model - the __*VistA Data Model*__ - is comprehensively exposed, enriched, and operationalized as a single, secure, standard, server-side interface for all clinical operational VISTA data.  The VISTA Data Model is in turn normalized across all local VISTA system data models to create a single national, normalized __*Master Veteran Data Model*__ (MVDM), allowing read-write transactions across all VA VistA systems using a single, secure, veteran-centric, model-driven mechanism, MVDM Services:

*The figure above summarizes the evolution from __thousands of unique, inconsistent, insecure, unidirectional code-based interfaces__ to that of a __single, secure, standard, server-side, symmetric (bidirectional), service-based master data model-driven interface__.*
