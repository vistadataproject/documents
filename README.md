# VISTA Data Project

The Veterans Information Systems Technology Architecture ([VISTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VistA)) is the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs integrated longitudinal  clinical, business, and administrative information system supporting the operations of over 1200 VA hospitals and clinics nationwide.  

The VISTA Data Project is a new data-centric, model-driven approach to VA master data management, interfacing, and security.  VISTA's operational data model - the roadmap to all of VA's institutional, business, and clinical processes and data - has evolved organically over the past 35 years, but has never been extracted in a modern computable form.

Now, for the first time, VA's true native operational clinical and business data model - the VISTA Data Model - will be comprehensively exposed, enriched, and operationalized as a single, secure, symmetric read-write, server-side interface for all clinical operational VISTA data. 

The VISTA Data Model is in turn normalized across all local VISTA system data models to create a national, standardized Master Veteran Data Model (MVDM), allowing read-write transactions across all VA VISTA systems using a single, secure, veteran-centric, model-driven mechanism, MVDM Services:
