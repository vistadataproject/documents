## Issue Tracking / Dashboards
Github issues are flat lists specific to one git. You can organize to milestones and with labels but other grouping is needed and as the Project has many gits, one view across all would be useful. Any help generating summary reports would be useful for informing stakeholders.

Examples to try:
 * https://github.com/integrations
  * Zube (https://zube.io/) which may allow Deliverable/Issue break down and grouping as well as Sprint tracking support.
